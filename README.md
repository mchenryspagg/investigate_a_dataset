# Investigate_a_dataset

### What
Showcase ability to investigate a dataset.

### How
This project demonstrates the student's ability to use python data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy and pyplot in matplotlib to investigate a dataset and answer specific questions from the dataset, thus demonstrating the requisite know-how in data cleaning, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis using statistical analysis and visualizations.

## Overview
The Dataset consists of the data related to the medical appointment details of 110,527 persons in Brazil. The data is focused on showing if the patients that booked appointment dates actually showed up for their appointments. The dataset is broken down into 14 associated variables (characteristics) and the variables would be further explained 

The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments?select=KaggleV2-May-2016.csv)

### The challenge 
The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset of medical appointment records for Brasil public hospitals. The data includes some attributes of patients and state if the patients showed up to appointments.


### Outcome
 The analysis should be focused on finding trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments. Using descriptive statistics and appropriate visualizations to showcase relationships, the following questions are considered:
 
1. What gender books more medical appointments
2. Does awaiting time interval have any effect on patients showing up for appointments.
3. What factors are important for us to know if patients will show up for their appointments
4. Is there a relationship between age and having a scholarship?

The project detailed analysis is available here - [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/henryokam/noshowappointment-investigate-a-dataset) or [Jupyter notebook](./Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

### Built with

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy libraries.

### What was learnt

The ability of investigate any dataset, understand the dataset, ask questions from a dataset, carry out appropriate data wrangling and data cleaning processes, perform exploratory data analysis to answer set questions from dataset by investigating trends and relationship in the data.

### Key Insights

- More females booked for appointment compared to their male counterparts.
- Awaiting time interval wasn't found to have any major effect on awaiting time interval
- There was no distinct feature that was noticed to have had an effect on patients showing up for their appointments.
-  No relationship was found in the age of patients been attributed to them getting a scholarship


### Continued development

This is the first data analysis project in an Udacity Nanodegree program. Further learning is still been undertaken in python as at the time this project was completed. More project would be worked on and subsequently.
